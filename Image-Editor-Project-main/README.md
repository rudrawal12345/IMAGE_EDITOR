# Image Editor Project

In order to get some insights of the working of JavaScript, I have worked on this project, Image Editor.
Here we can upload any image from our device, edit it, like adjusting brightness, saturation, rotation and some features. And then save it in our device.

Working on this project I learned about the cncepts of JavaScript and its functions and working.
